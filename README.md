#### Notes:
The QR codes that "unlock" a habitat contain simply its identifier number: 1, 2, ..., 8, 9.
A simple QR code generator (e.g. https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/) can be used to generate them and simulate what would be present in the real zoo environment.

If one wants to reset the application's progress (to lock all the habitats again or to review the introductory slides), this can be done by acessing the device's settings and clearing the app's storage.

Althought the animal information (contained in the Firebase's database) is in english, the application itself will adapt to the device's language - supporting english (default) and portuguese.
